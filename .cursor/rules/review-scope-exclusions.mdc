# Code Review Scope Exclusions

This rule clarifies what should NOT be commented on during code reviews, helping focus reviewer attention on meaningful architectural and design issues rather than automated checks.

## When to Use

- Always apply during code reviews.
- Use as a filter to avoid wasting review effort on automated checks.

## Scope / Exclusions

- **Scope:** Defines exclusions (what NOT to review).
- **Applies to:** All code reviews.

## Core Rules

### 1. Do Not Comment on Lint-Level Issues

**Prohibited Review Comments:**
- ❌ Unused imports
- ❌ Unused variables
- ❌ Trailing spaces, indentation, or other formatting issues
- ❌ Any issue that ESLint/Prettier/automated linters detect

**Rationale:**
1. The project has pre-commit hooks and CI pipelines that enforce lint checks.
2. Code that fails linting cannot be committed or merged; it will not reach code review.
3. Reviewers (especially LLMs) may see only diff fragments and incorrectly flag variables as unused when they are used elsewhere.
4. Wastes review bandwidth on issues that are already automatically caught.

**What Reviewers SHOULD Focus On:**
- ✅ Architectural design and abstraction levels
- ✅ Business logic correctness
- ✅ Security and performance concerns
- ✅ Team conventions and best practices
- ✅ Maintainability and readability
- ✅ Correct use of project-specific patterns (Provider/Controller/Service, state management, hooks)

### 2. Ignore Automatic CSS Class Reordering

**Prohibited Review Comments:**
- ❌ "Why did the class order change?"
- ❌ "Suggest maintaining the original class order."

**Context:**
- Prettier and Tailwind CSS plugins automatically reorder Tailwind classes.
- This is intentional and improves consistency across the project.

**Example (Ignore These Changes):**
```diff
- "mb-6_5 mx-auto w-29"
+ "mx-auto mb-6_5 w-29"
```

**Exception:**
- ✅ Only flag class order changes if they cause functional bugs (e.g., incorrect responsive breakpoint precedence leading to broken styles).

---

### 3. Other Tooling-Managed Issues

**Do Not Comment On:**
- Type errors already caught by TypeScript (reviewers should assume code compiles).
- Test failures already reported by CI (unless discussing root cause in context).
- Dependency version conflicts flagged by package manager.

---

## Review Philosophy

- **Automated tools handle syntax and style.**
- **Humans handle semantics, design, and maintainability.**
- Focus review effort where it adds the most value.

## Review Checklist (Negative)

- [ ] Am I commenting on an unused import/variable? (Don't—linter catches it.)
- [ ] Am I questioning automatic class reordering? (Don't—formatter handles it.)
- [ ] Is this a formatting/spacing issue? (Don't—pre-commit hook enforces it.)
- [ ] Could this comment be replaced by a lint rule? (If yes, consider adding the rule instead.)

## Rationale

Maximizes the value of human code review by focusing on issues that require judgment, domain knowledge, and architectural understanding, rather than mechanical issues already handled by tooling.
