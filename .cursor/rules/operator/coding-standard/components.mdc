# Coding Standard - Components

## Definitions

- **Component**: The smallest reusable unit in the project.
- **Page**: A special kind of component mainly used to **register routes**; it should also host system-level wrappers (e.g. skeleton/loading/base layout styles).

## Rules

### 1. Reuse & extraction

- **Must**: If a piece of UI/logic will be reused across multiple pages or components, extract it into a dedicated component.
- **Avoid**: Hard-coding reusable parts inside a single page, which leads to copy-paste duplication later.

### 2. Page responsibility boundary

- **Must**: A Page should be a router entry only, and be wrapped by a base component to centralize system-level concerns (skeleton/loading/base layout styles, etc.).
- **Avoid**: Accumulating large reusable UI in a Page; extract into module/components and compose them in the Page.
